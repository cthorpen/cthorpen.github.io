									<h1>Who is Cole?</h1>
									<p>
										Hello! I'm Cole Thorpen, an aspiring data scientist in Seattle, WA.
										<br />
										This is my space to share about myself and my journey in building a career.
										<br />
										Let me tell you a bit about my story!
									</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>
									Once again, I'm Cole, a first-year graduate student at the University of Washington in Seattle looking to 
									become the next great data scientist. But first, I'll share a bit about my background. I was born and raised in Casper, Wyoming 
									where I spent all of my childhood. From a young age, I took a fascination in the two worlds of sports and mathematics. Not 
									two things that many kids think go together, and I wasn't an exception. It wasn't until recent memory that I found a way to combine the two 
									passions I had. 
								</p>
								<p>
									I graduated from Gonzaga University in 2022 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Here, I took a liking to developing applications for 
									iOS and Android mobile devices, and a bit of web development, too. Soon after graduation, I decided that software development was not quite the 
									passion I had thought it was. I took some time off and worked as a retail salesman for Filson in Seattle. Here, I learned many valuable skills in 
									teamwork and leadership, two things I felt my undergraduate education lacked. I wasn't doing any technical work during this job, but all throughout 
									2023, I craved the satisfaction I got from developing software. I knew I didn't want to be a 'pure' developer, but I wanted something similar. It was 
									then when I came across the Master's of Science in Information Management program at the University of Washington. When I learned of this program, I 
									knew it was a perfect mix of the technical and managerial work that I wanted so bad. After starting the program, I was pleased to know that I could use my 
									analytical/mathematical mind and managerial mind at once. In this program, I specialize in the Data Science and Program/Product Management & Consulting concentrations. 
									Now, not only am I working on developing ML models, exploratory data analyses, and interpretations, I'm also learning how to be a fair and effective 
									leader/manager. This opportunity has made me excited to step into the world of data science/business intelligence, where I can use my skills to 
									solve real-world problems.  
								</p>
								<p>
									I'm excited to see what opportunities arise in this next chapter of my life, and I hope to keep everyone updated on how it's going via this personal 
									website I've made! Here, I hope to keep everyone updated not only on my the types of projects I've worked on, but all the other happenings going on around me. 
									Join me on this wild journey of life, it'll be fun!
