									<h1>Who's Cole?</h1>
									<p>
										Hello! I'm Cole Thorpen, a data scientist in New York, NY.
										<br />
										This is my space to share my story and career-building journey.
										<br />
										Let me tell you a bit about me!
									</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/me.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>
									Hi, I’m Cole! I'm a third-year graduate student in the MSIM Online program at the University of Washington, currently working on my capstone project.
									I grew up in Casper, Wyoming, where I first discovered a love for both sports and mathematics. At the time, they felt like two separate worlds, 
									but over the years I’ve found ways to connect those passions through data, analysis, and storytelling. 
									That journey is what ultimately led me toward data science.
								</p>
								<p>
									I graduated from Gonzaga University in 2022 with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science, focusing on web and mobile applications.
									After graduation, I explored different paths and worked in retail sales at Filson in Seattle, where I developed strong teamwork and leadership skills. 
									These experiences helped me realize that I wanted a career that combined both analytical thinking and impactful problem-solving.
								</p>
								<p>
									Currently, I work as a Data Analyst for a heavy machinery dealership, partnering with executive leaders to provide actionable insights through internal 
									and customer-facing KPIs. I’m fluent in SQL and experienced in Power BI, Tableau, data warehousing, and data mining. My work helps improve warehouse 
									transparency, optimize operations, and drive business decisions, giving me a chance to see the real-world impact of data every day.
								</p>
								<p>
									I’ve always been analytical, constantly looking for the why behind things. That mindset drew me to the Master of Science in Information Management 
									program at the University of Washington. It was the perfect mix of technical and management work. I’m specializing in Data Science and 
									Program/Product Management & Consulting, where I develop machine learning models, perform exploratory analyses, and sharpen my leadership skills. 
									This balance has me excited to step into data science and business intelligence to solve real-world problems.
								</p>
								<p>
									I’m looking forward to the next chapter of my journey and will be using this site to share updates along the way. 
									Here, you’ll find not only the projects I’ve been working on, but also a bit about what’s going on in my world outside of work.
