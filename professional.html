										<p>
											To whom it may concern,
											<br/><br/> 
											Hello, my name is Cole Thorpen and I am searching for entry-level data science
											positions primarily, but not exclusively, in the Seattle area. I'm extremely enthusiastic to continue my journey
											in the world of data science and business intelligence, and showcase my analytical skills in very meaningful ways.
											<br/> <br/> 
											Throughout my professional and academic careers, I have gained much experience that's proven valuable in many fields. 
											My technical career began during my undergraduate tenure at Gonzaga University where I studied computer science. During this time,
											I focused on developing my skills in mobile and web-based application development. Learned skills included iOS (Swift, Objective-C),
											Android (Java, Kotlin), and working with full MERN stack applications (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). I developed great 
											knowledge in data science as well. Using Python, I created a class of data classification and regression algorithms based on the Sci-Kit Learn
											library. Now, during my graduate career at the University of Washington, I have continued to grow my data science experience into a well-rounded 
											set of skills. I've used my Python and SQL skills to develop data science projects available on GitHub. My experience as a sales associate 
											as proven valuable thorugh my pseudo-managerial position. 
											<br/> <br/> 
											I am the best candidate for any data science/analysis role because of my determination and willingness to learn. Not only do I 
											wish to perform complex analysis, but I want to fully understand what I am working with. My curiosity fuels my work and pushes me to 
											become a better version of myself every day. I am specifically passionate about the field of sports and health/fitness. My goal is to use 
											my analysis skills to accurately predict how susceptible athletes are to injuries, and find patterns in data that allow us to see why injuries 
											may occur. However, due to my general curiosity for data, I want to learn about many different industries. I am aware that my career is just 
											beginning, and there is a lot for me to learn before becoming a professional. Because of this, I use my abilities the best I can and treat everything as   
											a learning experience.
											<br/> <br/> 
											My excitement to continue this part of my journey is unparalleled, and I cannot wait to embark on the next step. Data science and analysis is 
											my strongest passion, and I will seize every opportunity I get. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to contacting you in the future. 
											To schedule a time to talk, or if you have any questions about me, you can reach me in any way via my contact information at the bottom of the page. 
											<br/> <br/> 
											Sincerely,
											<br/>
